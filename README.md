Code files in this repository covers the main analyses:

1. Data acquisition from original database;

2. Metabolome-wide associations for all-cause mortality;

3. Metabolomic modules associated with all-cause mortality and pathway analysis;

4. Selection of metabolomic biomarkers for predicting all-cause mortality;

5. Discrimination and reclassification analyses of all-cause mortality using metabolic biomarkers;
